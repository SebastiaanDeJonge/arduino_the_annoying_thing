This little projects creates random sounds through the piezo speaker. The range (in Hz) can be defined at the top of the code (`frequencyLowerBound`, `frequencyUpperBound`). The interval/duration of each tone is determined by the current state of the potentiometer. As the potentiometer is turned open the tone slows done.
